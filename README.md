# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players take turns placing X and O on a 3x3 grid. The game detects wins, draws, and allows resetting for new rounds. Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly project to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript.
